# Numbering

Numbering plans can be painful, so its suggested we largely stick with the current numbering plan for the relevant region. 

UK Users will be able to claim a number or prefix from either an area code of their choice, or some of the non-geographic ranges.

For other countries its assumed they'll use their own national numbering plan, but hopefully this will be managed locally.

One potential problem to solve further down the line is handling numbers that have changed over the decades, such as numbers changing to `01` on [PhONEday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhONEday). Some existing networks aim to replicate the numbering plan of a certain period, but ideally all users should be able to dial the number in their preferred time periods format. It might be possible to handle this with a translation layer, but numbering plans are complex beasts.
