# Numbering

Initially it was assumed that for the UK at least, we'd stick with the existing national numbering scheme, area codes etc. As the idea of DNUM being made up of a hierarchy of autonomous groups has matured, it's become apparent that this might not be the best approach.

Instead something like the following might be more practical:

`+444-1234-123456`

Which could be broken down as:

| Organisation  | Sub-organisation | Subscriber  |
|----------|----------|----------|
| +444 | 1234 | 123456 |

This scheme could be potentially split down further if more granularity is required.

The proposed scheme might result in long numbers that are unpleasant to dial from a rotary phone, but it's assumed that most dialling will take place within your "locality" - meaning the prefixes can be omitted. 

Some more refinement is probably needed here as we move forward.
