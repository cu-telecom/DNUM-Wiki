The **D**irectory, **N**umber & **U**RI **M**anagement (DNUM) project was born from a vague aspiration to create a publicly available [ENUM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6116) platform to allow hobbyist telephony platforms to "federate" over the public internet.

The initial concept was a single "domain" with strict policies on things like encryption and verification, but after giving it more thought it became clear that instead, number blocks could be issued out to sub-groups, and they could have the autonomy to create their own policies.

For more information on the proposal, see the [Technical Overview](./technical/index.md) section.

## Disclaimer

* Things are rapidly evolving, plans might change.
* At present this is just an experiment. It may never come to fruition, or die off like many other projects before it.

## FAQ

* Why DNUM? - It was a temporary name but after chucking together the logo, and creating a backronym, we quite like it.
* Why DNUM and not ENUM? - The RFC6116 explicitly states you can't use the term "ENUM" to describe a [DDDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Delegation_Discovery_System) service for private numbering plans. Lame.
* But I'm happy using my existing network? - It's hoped we can offer a method of peering into existing networks, but it should also be possible to configure your system to interconnect with multiple networks. 
* Can I claim the same number I use on the PSTN? - Probably not.
