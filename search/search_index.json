The goal for DNUM is to use existing standards to provide simple, efficient and secure call routing - Namely SIP, ENUM, STIR/SHAKEN and DNSSEC.</p> <p>Unfortunatly despite giving it some thought, a fully decentralised approach appears to be difficult to achive with the current vision of using certificates to secure and verify the various components. However, the ENUM specification supports delegation, which should allow for regional groups to operate semi-autonomously or independently.</p> <p>For more information on the proposal, see the Technical section.</p>"},{"location":"#disclaimer","title":"Disclaimer","text":"<ul> <li>This Wiki has been chucked together to gauge interest and start conversations.

Lame.</li> <li>But I'm happy using my existing network? - It's hoped we can offer a method of peering into existing networks, but it should also be possible to configure your system to interconnect with multiple networks. </li> <li>Can I claim the same number I use on the PSTN? - On initial thought this should probably be avoided. If its available, you could claim the number, but we probably won't be reserving numbers, verifying ownership of the PSTN number, or encouraging the use of using DNUM to lookup PSTN numbers in the hope of reaching the right person.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contact-us","title":"Contact Us","text":"<p>We're currently coordinating on the CuTEL Discord Server</p>"},{"location":"technical/","title":"Technical","text":"<p>Click on the links on the left, until we write something here</p>"},{"location":"technical/encryption/","title":"Encryption","text":"<p>Encryption could be optional, but highly encouraged.</p>"},{"location":"technical/encryption/#sip-signalling","title":"SIP Signalling","text":"<p>to encrypt the SIP signalling it's up for discussion if we use standard certificates from the likes of Let's Encrypt, or operate a CA to issue our own certificates.
